Project Summary - The project delves into an extensive dataset sourced from Flixable, offering a comprehensive snapshot of Netflix's content library up until 2019. Noteworthy findings emerged, including a remarkable surge in TV show offerings since 2010, contrasting with a substantial drop in movie titles during the same period.

A systematic approach was adopted, commencing with a meticulous review of the dataset's structure and contents. Rigorous data cleaning procedures were then implemented, ensuring the dataset was primed for in-depth analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) unveiled intriguing patterns, trends, and overarching behaviors within the dataset.

To facilitate clustering, a series of text preprocessing techniques were deployed, encompassing the removal of stop words, extraneous characters, and numerical values. This refinement process uncovered pivotal keywords instrumental in shaping the subsequent clusters.

Two distinct methodologies were applied to ascertain the optimal number of clusters for the analysis: the Silhouette Method and the K-Means Elbow Method. These strategies provided a robust foundation for grouping analogous TV shows and movies based on their intrinsic characteristics.

The project culminated in the development of a recommender system, leveraging cosine similarityâ€”a potent technique measuring the likeness between items in the dataset. This empowered the system to offer tailored recommendations, suggesting the top five movies akin to a user's stated preferences.

In summary, this exhaustive analysis of the Netflix dataset yielded profound insights into the dynamic evolution of available content on the platform. The integration of clustering and the recommender system revolutionized the user experience, enabling individuals to unearth pertinent TV shows and movies in alignment with their tastes.

In stark contrast, the platform experienced a notable reduction in its movie offerings, with over 2,000 titles being removed during the same period. This dichotomy raises intriguing questions and opens up avenues for deeper exploration.

Our primary objective is to delve into this dataset with a meticulous approach. This involves rigorous data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and text preprocessing. By doing so, we aim to unearth further fascinating patterns and trends within Netflix's extensive content library. Potential insights waiting to be discovered include identifying prevalent genres, pinpointing top-rated TV shows and movies, discerning regional viewing preferences, tracking release patterns over the years, and gauging user sentiment for different titles. These insights hold the potential to significantly influence Netflix's decision-making processes concerning content acquisition, user engagement strategies, and overall content curation.

Furthermore, we intend to leverage advanced clustering techniques, such as k-means, to group together TV shows and movies that share similar characteristics. This clustering analysis has the potential to unveil hidden patterns and preferences among the audience, which, in turn, can empower Netflix to deliver highly personalized content recommendations to its users.

In addition to clustering, we plan to construct a robust recommender system utilizing collaborative filtering or content-based filtering approaches. This system will serve to augment the user experience by suggesting TV shows and movies that align closely with individual viewing histories and preferences.

In summation, our endeavor to explore this dataset presents a distinctive opportunity to gain invaluable insights into the evolving landscape of content on Netflix. It offers a nuanced understanding of the shifting preferences of the platform's audience over the years. These insights, when appropriately harnessed, have the potential to not only optimize content curation but also enhance user satisfaction and drive strategic decisions for the streaming service.

Summary and Conclusion:

In this project, we tackled a text clustering issue where we had to categorize Netflix shows into specific clusters such that the shows within a cluster are similar to one another and the shows in different clusters are dissimilar to one another.

1. The project aimed to address a text clustering task, where the primary objective was to categorize Netflix shows into specific clusters. The goal was to group shows within a cluster that are similar to each other, based on their attributes and content, while ensuring that shows in different clusters are dissimilar.

2. During the data preprocessing stage, the dataset was checked for duplicates and missing values. Fortunately, no duplicate entries were found. However, certain columns, such as director, cast, country, and date_added, had missing values. To address this, appropriate values were used to fill in the missing entries.

3. The analysis revealed that movie shows account for 69% of Netflix's content, whereas TV shows make up 31%. This indicates that Netflix has a more extensive collection of movie content than TV shows.

4. Over the years, Netflix has been steadily adding more shows to its platform. The majority of movies were released in 2017 and 2018, while most television shows were added in 2019 and 2020. It is suggested that the decline in the number of movies added in 2020 might be attributed to the COVID-19-induced lockdowns that affected show production.

5. Netflix's focus on expanding its movie show library is evident, as it has been adding movie content at a faster rate than TV shows.
